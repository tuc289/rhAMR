This Repository will be used to archive essential script for rhAMR sequencing analysis

## Getting start

### Table of contents

1. Whole genome sequencing assembly and AMR gene alignment to Megares (v2) database
3. Human fecal metagenomics samples processing and AMR gene alignment (MG-Rast)
4. rhAMR data analysis by AMRplusplus2
5. Visualization of the results
